# LibraryProject
Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

This project is designed to test my ability to work with large datasets and build algorithms based on those datasets.

with this project you will be :

Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor

Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types

Solving bugs by using error messages

Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately

Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings

Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals

Accessing all the values and keys of an object

Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems

Using reduce() to solve different problems

Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways
